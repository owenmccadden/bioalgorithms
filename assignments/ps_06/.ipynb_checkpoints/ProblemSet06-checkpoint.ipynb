This file has genotypes with chromosome and position for eight founder mouse strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, WSB/EiJ) followed by columns of new strains, one named for each student in Comp555. Look for your Comp555 username to identify your mouse strain and  infer a mosaic of founders that maximizes your strain's genotypes using the following assumptions. The likelihood of a genotyping error is 1%, and the probabily of a recombination between two genotypes can be modeled by an exponential function with a 50% probability of a change of founders when the genotype loci are separated by 20 Mbases. In space below print a line with each marker's position, your sample's genotype at that position, and the most likely founder for that genotype in your strain.    "
